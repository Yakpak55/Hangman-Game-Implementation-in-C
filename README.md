# Hangman-Game-Implementation-in-C
Developed a C program to simulate the classic Hangman game, where users guess letters to reveal a hidden word. 

The project involved:

● Game Rules and Interface: Implemented game rules and a user-friendly command-line interface that guides players through the game, including displaying the masked word, accepting guesses, and tracking strikes.

● File Handling: Utilized file operations to read a list of words from an external file (words.txt), ensuring a dynamic and varied gameplay experience.

● String Manipulation: Used string functions to mask the word with asterisks and reveal correct guesses, ensuring real-time updates to the displayed word.

● Gameplay Logic: Incorporated logic to handle user guesses, update the masked word, and count strikes. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or accumulates six strikes.

● Replay Option: Provided an option for players to play multiple rounds, enhancing user engagement.
